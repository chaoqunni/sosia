sosia: Automatic author matching in Scopus on-line
==================================================

sosia (Italian for *doppelg√§nger*) creates control groups for authors, by searching the Scopus database using `pybliometrics <https://pybliometrics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.  After configuring your local pybliometrics (providing access credentials and eventually setting cache directories), you can use sosia

It is written in Python 3, by econometric scientists for econometric scientists.

=======
Example
=======

Install sosia from PyPI using the console or command line interpreter:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install sosia

In Python, set up sosia (and eventually pybliometrics) and search for similar scientists using their Scoups Author Profile IDs.
